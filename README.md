## Blockchain Representation

Implement Blockchain as a Graph Using Hashing

## Digital Signature Mechanism

Implement Signature Generation Using Dynamic Programming and Hashing
Use dynamic programming (DP) to break down the document signing process into incremental steps. Each step stores the intermediate signature, and SHA-256 hashing is applied at each step to ensure the integrity of the signature.

## Signature Verification

Implement Signature Verification Using Dynamic Programming
For signature verification, break down the process into subproblems, storing intermediate results for efficiency. The documentâ€™s signature is recalculated, and its integrity is verified by comparing the newly calculated signature to the stored one in the blockchain.

## Pattern Matching for Document Integrity

Implement Pattern Matching to Validate Document Integrity
Use Pattern Matching techniques to validate the integrity of the document by detecting any illegal changes in the document text. Implement Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) or Rabin-Karp to check if the document data matches the expected signature content.

## Blockchain Security (Prevent Tampering, Consensus Algorithm)

- Prevent Tampering in the Blockchain
    Hashing is a crucial component in preventing tampering. Each block stores a hash of its contents and the hash of the previous block. This ensures that even if a block is tampered with, the hash will change, and the integrity of the blockchain will be compromised.
- Implement a Consensus Algorithm
    Implement a Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism to ensure that only valid blocks are added to the blockchain. This method involves solving a computational problem (finding a hash with specific characteristics) to add a block to the chain.

## Testing and Demonstration

- Test the Blockchain
    Ensure the integrity of the blockchain by adding blocks and verifying that the hash values match the expected hashes.
    Ensure tampering detection works: any attempt to alter a block should invalidate the blockchain.
- Demonstration
    Provide a demonstration of signing, adding, and verifying documents. Show how hashing ensures the integrity of the blockchain and how the consensus algorithm prevents tampering.
